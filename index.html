      Flutes have always been played in two different positions. Both
      vertically and horizontally. The flute is <em>the</em> oldest
      woodwind instrument. The first most likely coming from China.
      It was an important instrument in courtly music, military signaling,
      and marching.

      There is a real stretch of history when it comes to the history of the
      flute. In the <code>1600s-1700s</code>, individual soloists were born. Where they added
      their own flare, as more registers were added to the flute. Today there are
      a range of famous flutes ranging from classical to R&B. Here are a list of some
      of them:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>James Galway</li>
      <li>Herbie Mann</li>
      <li>Alexa Hayes</li>
      <li>Brian Jackson</li>
      <li>Gaubert</li>

    <p>
      There are many different types of flutes. But people only seem to know
      3 types, the standard, piccolo and harmony flutes. Today, many
      people tend to play flutes that are in the horizontal position starting
      off with the concert flute. We know now, that the flute is also played
      transversely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's not be boring people and stick with the original way that people
      tend to play the flute. Let's expand our repetoire. To do that, here is a list
      of other flutes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Piccolo</code></li>
      <li><code>Alto Flute</code></li>
      <li><code>Bass Flute</code></li>
      <li><code>Concert Flute</code></li>
      <li><code>Contrabass Flute</code></li>
      <li><code>Bansuri Bamboo Flute</code></li>

      Before you start learning to play the flute, there are some music
      theory items that you should know. Don't be one of those people
      who know absolutely nothing about notes or anything. You will just
      make your life so much harder. I'm the expert, you are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am extremely tired of doing this. It is kind of stupid. What exactly
      do I know about this, that I could possibly offer to this mess of a
      technical page.

      It is important to know the anatomy of your flute before getting
      started. Many people start playing, me, without knowing anything about
      the instrument they plan on learning to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many parts to the flute that are important to know before you
      are allowed to play. Here we go:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the barrel</li>
      <li>the crown</li>
      <li>the embouchre hole</li>
      <li>the foot joint</li>
      <li>the head joint</li>
      <li>the middle joint</li>
      <li>the keys</li>
      <li>the lip plate</li>
    </ul>

    How Do You Play?
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>
      The first thing we want you to know how to do is learn
      how to put your flute together. I think it is pretty
      self-explanatory. Dont be that idiot. Do it. NOW.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second thing is learning how to make a sound. Get a straw.
    You got one? Good. Place it on top of the hole. You did it?
    Good. Now blow into the straw and move it around until that
    sweet, sweet sound comes out. Lovely. You got the first step down.
    Figure the rest of it  on your own.
